'diamond rotations' presents a situation for musicians to discover closed harmonic shapes which rotate along discrete points. The pitch groups are 'shapes' as they are arranged on 2 dimensional planes defined by prime harmonic ratios (2/1, 3/2, 5/4, 7/4) and they are 'closed' as there are no end points (each point is connected to two others). The players are arranged in a diamond shape which mirrors the shape defined in harmonic space. At each station is a computer providing the synthesized tone corresponding to one of the points in the harmonic shape. Every set of adjacent points produces a pair of combination tones, which the performer is asked to play and tune (often bending microtonally to achieve the right intonation). The performer then seeks out the second point/station which produces their combination tone. While the diamond shape of the performers mirrors that of the harmonic shape, the points are scrambled so the performers must rely on their ears to find the correct second point. Once the second points have been discovered, the shape rotates along one point to a new plane (so at least one pitch will remain constant) with a different set of prime ratios and the process begins again. While each shape is predefined, the rotations are variable with the performers occupying different points in each iteration. As the cycle unfolds and repeats the harmonic clarity will constantly fluctuate leaving the shape to reveal itself, perhaps, only momentarily.
